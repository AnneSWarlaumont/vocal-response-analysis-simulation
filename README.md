This is the codebase for a project that simulates daylong series of human infant and adult vocalization events. The series are distributed in hierarchical clusters over time, matched to what is observed in examples from daylong LENA recordings of human infants. Different versions simulate different patterns of interactivity on the part of the adult and/or infant agent. The simulations serve as a testbed for different statistical analysis approaches, with varying degrees of control for the clustering of the agents' vocal behaviors.
